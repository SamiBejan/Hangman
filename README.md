# Hangman
This project replicates the Hangman game. <br>
The player must guess a hidden word by suggesting a letter.
If the suggested letter matches any letter of the word (can more more than one), this/these letters in the word will be revealed. 
If the suggested letter doesn't match any letter of the word, a new part of the hangman is built. If the player suggest an incorrect letter enough times so that the entire hangman is built, he losses the game. If he succeds to guess the word before the entire hangman is built, he wins the game.<br>
The players can add words to be guessed through an input and a button. Once the button is pressed, the input word is tranformed into a "*" word and added at the bottom of the page. Letters can be suggested through another input and button. 
After the game is completed (either won or lost), the "START AGAIN" button will reset the game.
